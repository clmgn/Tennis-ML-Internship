# Tennis-ML-Internship

This project was developed as part of an engineering internship, with the aim of analyzing muscle use during tennis practice using inertial sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope).
The goal is to detect the type of stroke performed (forehand, backhand, serve, etc.) and study the muscle groups most impacted based on stroke frequency.

# Objectives :

- Collect motion data using a smartwatch (accelerometer + gyroscope)
- Apply Machine Learning techniques to classify different tennis strokes
- Identify the most frequent strokes for each player
- Investigate the potential muscular impact caused by repetitive motion
